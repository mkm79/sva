\title{A function for quickly calculating f statistic p-values for use in sva}
\usage{
f.pvalue(dat, mod, mod0)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{The transformed data matrix with the variables in rows and samples in columns}

\item{mod}{The model matrix being used to fit the data}

\item{mod0}{The null model being compared when fitting the data}
}
\value{
p A vector of F-statistic p-values one for each row of dat.
}
\description{
This function does simple linear algebra to calculate f-statistics
for each row of a data matrix comparing the nested models
defined by the design matrices for the alternative (mod) and and null (mod0) cases.
The columns of mod0 must be a subset of the columns of mod.
